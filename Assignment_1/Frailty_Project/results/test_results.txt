The summary statistics provide an overview of the datasetâ€™s characteristics:

Height:
	Mean: 68.6 inches
	Range: 65.8 to 71.5 inches
Weight:
	Mean: 131.9 lbs
	Range: 112 to 153 lbs
Age:
	Mean: 32.5 years
	Range: 17 to 51 years
Grip Strength:
	Mean: 26 kg
	Range: 19 to 31 kg
Frailty (0 = No, 1 = Yes):
	Mean: 0.4 (40% of participants have frailty symptoms)
	Range: 0 to 1 (indicating some participants have frailty, while others do not)


The correlation matrix helps identify relationships between the variables:

Height & Weight: Moderate positive correlation (0.57), indicating taller individuals tend to weigh more.
Height & Age: Very weak negative correlation (-0.03), suggesting no significant relationship.
Height & Frailty:weak positive correlation (0.19) implies that taller individuals may be slightly more likely to be frail.
Weight & Grip Strength: Very weak positive correlation (0.03), suggesting minimal relationship.
Weight & Frailty: Moderate positive correlation (0.54), suggesting heavier individuals might be more prone to frailty.
Age & Grip Strength:very weak positive correlation (0.13) between age and grip strength. suggests that age alone may not be a strong predictor of grip strength.
Grip Strength & Frailty: Moderate negative correlation (-0.48), indicating that as grip strength decreases, the chance of frailty increases.
